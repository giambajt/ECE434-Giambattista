HW09

The readTemp.py script simply reads the three dallas 1-wire temperature
sensors and displays the temperatures in the shell window

demo.py needs token.pickle and credentials.json to interface with the
google sheets API.  There is no setup script since the device tree
is already loaded.  Simply run the demo.py script and it will work
