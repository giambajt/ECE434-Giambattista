The readTemp.sh script can just be run on its own. All i2c devices are on the second bus

The readTemp.py requires sudo priveliges

The interruptTemp.py also requires sudo priveliges to function

To use etch.py, setup.sh must be run first and then etch.py with sudo priveliges
etch.py uses two encoders and changes the LED matrix while also showing which square you are 
currently on in yellow
