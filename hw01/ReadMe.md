Welcome to my etch-a-sketch game using Pygame!

The game is very simple, when you run the file from the command line
an opening window will pop up with instructions on how to play. You can hit
the space bar to move on to the actual game. While the game is active, use
the arrow keys to control the etch-a-sketch and press space bar to "shake" the
pad.  Press escape at any time to close out of the game.

The actual etch-a-sketch window has a default size, but it can be manually set 
in the command line using two integers arguments for the x and y size.

For example, the command './etch.py 300 200' would have an etch-a-sketch window
with a width of 300 pixels and a height of 200 pixels.

Nice use of pygame.  I wish Ii knew why it's so slow.  Could you make the trace
wider?
